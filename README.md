# sentiment_analysis_twitter
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It was completed 6 months ago as part of my machine learning practice and showcases fundamental NLP preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Preprocess and clean text data

Convert text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or embeddings

Train machine learning models to predict sentiment

Evaluate and visualize model performance

ðŸ§  Techniques Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

Feature extraction (TF-IDF / word embeddings)

Supervised learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or others)

Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
